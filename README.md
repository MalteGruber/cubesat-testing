# CubeSat Testing
This repository contains files relating to my master thesis. While the focus of the thesis was on hardware, I did work quite a bit on software as well. That said, the software that exists is more of a proof of concept than a release-ready framework. It was created because I had fun and I share it in the hope that It might be of some use.

## Content
This repository contains both code for a test coordination system and hardware for physical testing, code that is embedded into the hardware is also included.
